# Pictionary Online

A Multiplayer Pictionary Game:
- **Server:** A Python file with FastAPI + WebSockets (Uvicorn)
- **Client:** A HTML file , no install required
- **Features:** Rooms, drawer/guesser roles, random/choice modes, admin tools, colors/brush/eraser, chat filtering

## How to Use / Hosting

This repo is so the server can run on Render:

- To run just run the html file
- When it first runs it's pretty laggy so after you press join wait like a minute but after that it will be fine
